#  NASDAQ Composite Index Prediction

This project applies statistical learning techniques to predict the NASDAQ Composite Index, combining my interests in Economics and Data Science. Using historical stock data from January 4, 2010, to October 25, 2024, the analysis focuses on identifying key predictors of stock price movements, assessing the impact of seasonality, and evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models for time-series forecasting. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is implemented to predict closing prices from July to November 2024, leveraging features such as historical price trends, volatility indices, and moving averages to enhance predictive accuracy.
